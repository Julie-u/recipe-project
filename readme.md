Hi Rocco,
I don't know if you saw my message on Slak asking for +24 hours to work on this project, as I am really struggling with the responsive part.

I hope you did, and it's ok

Thanks in advance,
Best,
Julie

Hi Rocco, 
a little update since i'm stoping working on it now, because I just think it's going messier if I try again and again.

I have some issues with margin collapse and of course with the all grid thing. I tried with flex after rewatching all the recorded session but I just didn't knew where to start.

Grid looks comprehensive but as usual, it's simple when you show us but when I try it's not the same..

I will continue to watch the recorded session and try to learn it better to catch up.
